        <p class="paragraph">Here's the harsh truth: I've reviewed more than 1,000 portfolios in my design career so far, and I turned 90% of them down because of one thing — <span>linear design process</span></p>
        <p  class="paragraph">By “linear design process” I mean cookie-cutter case studies that always read the same. The designer learned about a problem, conducted user interviews, created user personas, proceeded to sketches, then mockups and wireframes, made everything beautiful through visual design, created a prototype, and tested it with five users. Everything was perfect so they also created a design system which is not a design system but a style guide. But they call it a “design system” because it’s trendy and a keyword for the recruiters.</p>
        <p  class="paragraph">It's like finding a product that you want to buy online and it only has 5-star reviews. When everything is shown as perfect it loses credibility — are the reviews fake? It's the same when I review your cookie-cutter portfolio — when everything's perfect I wonder whether it's all fake.</p>
        <p  class="paragraph">The 90% is my estimation based on the many portfolios I reviewed, I don’t know what the exact number is, but it’s high. Most UX and product design portfolios have two case studies that are the same, it’s just the details that differ slightly.</p>
        <p  class="paragraph">I posted <a href="linkedIn-Post">a much shorter version of this post on LinkedIn</a> a couple of months ago and it went viral. Many experienced designers agreed:</p>
        <p class="blockquote"> Many case studies read to me like school homework: they knew what the answer
            and the process were “supposed to be” according to the textbook, so made up the
            story to fit. In reality, as you point out, it’s never smooth and linear. It’s messy
            and loopish. If you’re doing a good job, you rarely end up with anything remotely
            like you anticipated when you started out. ( <a href="#Source">Source</a> )</p>
        <p  class="paragraph">A design manager shared their perspective:</p>
        <p class="blockquote">If I see another case study that walks me through personas, walls of sticky notes,
            photos of customers being interviewed, and sketches from a notebook… I’m going
            to lose my freaking mind and pull out my hair.( <a href="#Source">Source</a> )</p>
        <p  class="paragraph">When I review such portfolios I can’t help but think that the designer behind
            them is either inexperienced, lacks a passion for design, or simply can’t
            communicate the value of their work. Sometimes, all of the above are true
            but even if only one is, it’s enough to be turned down by design-mature
            companies. This brings me to the second point.</p>
        <p  class="paragraph">A shallow portfolio with cookie-cutter case studies may get you a job in UX.
            But it’ll most likely be a job with a design-immature company that doesn’t
            fully understand design. You get stuck doing boring design work and your
            career stalls because the quality of your work never increases so you don’t
            have anything better to put in your portfolio. You get trapped in a loop.</p>
        <p class="emphasis">When I say 90% of designers are unhirable, what I
            mean is they’ll be turned down immediately by
            design-mature companies.</p>
